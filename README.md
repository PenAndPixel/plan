I have a LOT of existing Unity3D assets. I am not quite sure what I want to do for the game base. I don't want to do a ton of work but I want it to work like a Pen and Paper game than a traditonal RPG or MMO RPG. With a dungeon master and stuff. I have a lot of generative terrain stuff and a few different tile systems. I'm not against keeping is way stupid simple. Maybe even sprite based like Rimworld (https://store.steampowered.com/app/294100/RimWorld/) or something. Or maybe even simpler.

I dont intend for this to be a full on intensive thing. I figure it's something fun to hack on and I'm pretty sure I can get a reasonable system slapped together without much effort. I'll share the sources with y'all and stuff and we can fiddle around with it. I think it could be fun.

URPG isn't bad.
