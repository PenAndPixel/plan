I have a LOT of existing Unity3D assets. I am not quite sure what I want to do for the game base. I don't want to do a ton of work but I want it to work like a Pen and Paper game than a traditonal RPG or MMO RPG. With a dungeon master and stuff. I have a lot of generative terrain stuff and a few different tile systems. I'm not against keeping is way stupid simple. Maybe even sprite based like Rimworld (https://store.steampowered.com/app/294100/RimWorld/) or something. Or maybe even simpler. Using some generative assets at firs like stuff from https://nounproject.com

I would like this to bride to tabletop play easily. Either by playing on a screen set on a table or with a projector pointed at a table with a white tablecloth and a webcam maybe but also that should be required so people could join from their phone or computer or whatever.

**I dont intend for this to be a full on intensive thing. I figure it's something fun to hack on and I'm pretty sure I can get a reasonable system slapped together without much effort. I'll share the sources with y'all and stuff and we can fiddle around with it. I would like the keep the experiment light, fun, and preferably pretty stupid. 

I AM NOT TRYING TO BUILD A COMMERCIAL PRODUCT HERE. JUST THINKING OF COMPILING A LITTLE SANDBOX TO TELL STORIES WITH SOME FRIENDS.**

Charactor Creator 3 - https://www.reallusion.com/character-creator/
I have a license for this thing. It's crazy. I haven't used it much but it's a good place to start if we care about 3d? I'll make you a character. It might be crappy or weird, but I'll make you a character and you can use it in the game or 3D print it as a mini.


and MUCH MUCH MORE. I don't have time to list it all now. We can talk about it more if people are interested and hop on the Discord. I just wanted to get a place to put data and a chat server set up to guage people's interest.

Cheers!
